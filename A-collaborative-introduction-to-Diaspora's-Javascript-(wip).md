## An Intro to Diaspora's Javascript


Recently core contributor Dan Hansen (@ohaibbq) wrote us a nice little page and widget system to help us manage our JS for Diaspora.

Hopefully this page will be an ongoing guide to help people who want to fix small JS bugs, but feel intimidated by the process.

A good primer can be found here: http://groups.google.com/group/diaspora-dev/browse_thread/thread/24be8040b300bb18
