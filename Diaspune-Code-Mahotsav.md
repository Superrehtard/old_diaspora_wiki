**#Diaspune Code Mahotsav - coders' way to Diaspora*** aims to help students contribute to Diaspora. We are conducting a series of Ruby on Rails workshops and offering to mentor interested students. Those who complete the project successfully and once their code is accepted into diaspora they will be provided a certificate by Diaspora Inc.
