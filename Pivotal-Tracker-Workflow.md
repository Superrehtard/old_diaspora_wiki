Pivotal Tracker is a tool used primarily for agile development. It's useful for coordinating teams of people with tasks dealing with bugs, chores, and feature development. As our [Community Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/61641) has many members, it's good to follow these guidelines to avoid confusion. The purpose of our PT is to showcase things that need immediate attention. It is not intended to replace GitHub Issues, but instead, complement it.

Below are a set of guidelines to make our use of PT as efficient as possible.

## Milestone Markers

The milestone markers are used as sectional bookmarks. A group of items that appears under it is related to it. A milestone marker appears as a blue bar with a checkered flag on it. Under no circumstances are the markers intended to be finished, closed, moved, or otherwise tampered with. They're there for the sake of being organized.

## Claiming a bug or feature

Immediate issues from GitHub Issues and feature requests will be posted on Tracker under different sections. Those that wish to claim an item to work on can comment on the tracker item by saying "I will work on this." and they will be officially assigned to that task.

Those pursuing feature requests are encouraged to hit up the [Diaspora Developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/diaspora-dev) to talk about implementing a feature. 

### What to do if someone else has claimed a feature or bug that you'd like to help with

If it's a feature, try your best to get a hold of the original person working on it. More often than not, these developers would love an extra hand. 

If it's a bug, and there hasn't been any progress on it for a while, feel free to get a hold of the Dev mailing list with a concern over it not being worked on. If the original dev cannot be reached, you're welcome to take over on fixing the bug.

## Finishing a task

When your fixes have been merged in to Diaspora upstream, you need to mark your assigned task as "Finished". That's it!
