A lot of new contributors that want to dive in to helping fix bugs and develop new awesome things often ask "Well, where do I start?". Below are some links to comprehensive resources so that newcomers can get up to speed and get dive right in to fixing bugs.

### Getting started with GitHub

All of Diaspora's code is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com), a social coding platform that leverages [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/git) for many different Free and Open Source projects. You can use any operating system to contribute with GitHub, all you need is an account and to follow GitHub's [guide](http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/) for setting up your account from the command line and learning to use the commands. Git is supported on all major platforms.

### How to Hunt For Bugs

There are a couple different places worth considering for finding good bugs. You can always check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues?direction=desc&labels=bug&page=3&sort=created&state=open) queue, but sometimes it's not quite clear what the scope of a bug might entail. Maybe a random bug you find might be a really big bug that requires a lot of code, and maybe you're not up for that yet. To help get newcomers more up to speed with how Diaspora works, we started something called [Bug Mash Monday](http://devblog.joindiaspora.com/2012/01/30/introducing-bug-mash-monday/), a weekly bug sprint in which newcomers can co-ordinate with other contributors to get parts of the system fixed up. It teaches you how the system works, and in return, you get community recognition and shoutouts for the fixes you make. **(Note: that particular blog entry is old and purely exists as an example, check the devblog for the latest update for bugs to fix!)**

### How to Contribute the Right Way

Diaspora's development tries its very best to stick to a set of guidelines when it comes to contributing code. When you're writing a bugfix or custom code from scratch, it's good practice to ask yourself:

* Does my code have [tests](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Testing-workflow)?
* Am I sticking to the [Git Workflow](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Git-Workflow) the best I can?
