###BASICS

***What is a pod?***  
A pod is a server where Diaspora is running. There are lots of different pods. You can add friends from other pods and communicate with them. (You can think of a Diaspora pod as similar to an email provider: there are public pods, private pods, and with some effort you can even run your own.) "Pod" is a metaphor referring to pods on plants which contain seeds.

***Is there a directory that lists public pods (servers) that I can join?***  
Yes. For a list of unofficial, community-driven pods/servers, see [podupti.me](http://podupti.me/) and [[Community supported pods]].

***What is a seed?***  
A seed is a profile or an account, and contains all the data of a specific user.  Your seed interacts with the seeds of your friends to keep each other up to date.  You can see it as a package of personal data...which is all yours! Seeds are hosted on servers running the Diaspora software, which are called 'pods'. In the future you will be able to move your seed between pods. For now, you can export a file containing all your information.  "Seed" is a metaphor referring to seeds from a plant, which are contained in pods.

***What is an aspect?***  
See our separate [[aspects FAQ|Aspects FAQ]].

***Are there photo albums to collect and organize all photos (or videos) posted by a user?***  
No, not currently (but see [cubbi.es](http://cubbi.es/)).

***How can I format the text in my posts (Bold, Italics, etc.)?***  
By using [Markdown](http://diasporial.com/tutorials/formatting-text).

###PUBLIC POSTS

***When I post something publicly, who can see it?***  
Both logged-in Diaspora users and the internets at large can see a post you mark public.

***How can other people find my public post?***  
Public posts are visible to anyone on your pod's tag pages and your profile page. Every public post also has a special public URL that anyone can view, even if they're not logged in - thus public posts may be linked to directly from twitter, hn, etc. Public posts may also be indexed by search engines.

***Who can comment on my public post?***  
Any logged-in Diaspora user can comment on your public post.

***Who can reshare my public post?***  
Any logged-in Diaspora user can reshare your public post.

***Who can like my public post?***  
Any logged-in Diaspora user can like your public post.

***Does posting to "public" include contacts in any deselected aspects?***  
Yes, but the post will only appear in the stream for the selected aspects, even if everyone (the public) will be able to see it on your profile.

###PRIVATE POSTS

***When I post a message to an aspect (i.e., a private post), who can see it?***  
Only logged-in Diaspora users you have placed in that aspect can see your private post.

***Who can comment on my private post?***  
Only logged-in Diaspora users you have placed in that aspect can comment on your private post.

***Who can reshare my private post?***  
Nobody. Private posts are not resharable. Logged-in Diaspora users in that aspect can always copy & paste it, though...

***Who can like my private post?***  
Only logged-in Diaspora users you have placed in that aspect can like your private post.

###PUBLIC PROFILES

***Who sees my public profile?***  
Any logged-in Diaspora user, as well as the wider internets, can see it. Each profile has a direct URL, so it may be linked to directly from outside sites. It may be indexed by search engines.

***What's in my public profile?***  
Your name, your 5 tags, and your photo. It's the stuff in the top section of the edit profile page. Your profile page also shows any public posts you have made.

***Who sees updates to my public profile?***  
Anyone can see changes if they visit your profile page on your pod. Public profile updates also propagate to the pods of people you are following, and the pods of people who are following you. 

###PRIVATE PROFILES

***Who sees my private profile?***  
Any logged-in user that you are following (meaning, you have added them to one of your aspects). Specifically, people following you, but who you do NOT follow, see only your public information.

***What's in my private profile?***  
Bio, location, gender, and birthday. It's the stuff in the bottom section of the edit profile page. Logged-in users who can see your private profile will also see the private posts that they are allowed to see, mixed in with your public posts, when they visit your profile page.

***Who sees updates to my private profile?***  
Any logged-in user that you are following sees changes to your private profile. Changes are propagated to the pods of everyone you follow.
