## User FAQ

***Are there any public demo servers of Diaspora online that I can try?***  

Yes. For a list of unofficial, community-driven servers, see [podupti.me](http://podupti.me/) and [[Community supported pods]].

***What is a pod?***  

A pod is a server where Diaspora is running. There are lots of different pods. You can add friends from other pods and communicate with them. (You can think of a Diaspora pod as similar to an email provider: there are public pods, private pods, and with some effort you can even run your own.)

"Pod" is a metaphor referring to pods on plants which contain seeds.

***What is a seed?***  

A seed is a profile or an account, and contains all the data of a specific user. 
Your seed interacts with the seeds of your friends to keep each other up to date. 
You can see it as a package of personal data...which is all yours! 

Seeds are hosted on servers running the Diaspora software, which are called 'pods'. 
In the future you will be able to move your seed between pods. For now, you can export a file
containing all your information.

"Seed" is a metaphor referring to seeds from a plant, which are contained in pods.
