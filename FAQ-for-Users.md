###BASICS

***What is a pod?***  
A pod is a server where Diaspora is running. There are lots of different pods. You can add friends from other pods and communicate with them. (You can think of a Diaspora pod as similar to an email provider: there are public pods, private pods, and with some effort you can even run your own.) "Pod" is a metaphor referring to pods on plants which contain seeds.

***Is there a directory that lists public pods (servers) that I can join?***  
Yes. For a list of unofficial, community-driven pods/servers, see [podupti.me](http://podupti.me/) and [[Community supported pods]].

***What is a seed?***  
A seed is a profile or an account, and contains all the data of a specific user.  Your seed interacts with the seeds of your friends to keep each other up to date.  You can see it as a package of personal data...which is all yours! Seeds are hosted on servers running the Diaspora software, which are called 'pods'. In the future you will be able to move your seed between pods. For now, you can export a file containing all your information.  "Seed" is a metaphor referring to seeds from a plant, which are contained in pods.

***What is an aspect?***  
An aspect is how you group your contacts on Diaspora.  See our separate [[Aspects FAQ|Aspects FAQ]].  

***I just joined a pod, how can I find people to share with?***  
Invite your friends.  Follow hashtags to discover others who share your interests.  Meet new contacts on this [Diaspora Forum thread](http://www.diasporaforum.org/forum/showthread.php?233-Just-joined-a-Diaspora-pod-Looking-for-people-to-share-with).  

###PUBLIC POSTS

***When I post something publicly, who can see it?***  
Both logged-in Diaspora users and the internets at large can see a post you mark public.

***How can other people find my public post?***  
Public posts are visible to anyone on your pod's tag pages and your profile page. Every public post also has a special public URL that anyone can view, even if they're not logged in - thus public posts may be linked to directly from twitter, hn, etc. Public posts may also be indexed by search engines.

***Who can comment on, reshare, or like my public post?***  
Any logged-in Diaspora user can comment on, reshare, or like your public post.

***When I comment on, reshare, or like a public post, who can see it?***  
Any logged-in Diaspora user and anyone else on the internet.  Comments, likes, and reshares of public posts are also public.  

***I do not see links to like or comment on public posts on the tag pages?***  
Currently you need to click on the time stamp ("Posted an hour ago") to go to the post's page in order to like or comment on it.  (This is just temporary, and will be fixed in a future update.)  

###PRIVATE POSTS

***When I post a message to an aspect (i.e., a private post), who can see it?***  
Only logged-in Diaspora users you have placed in that aspect can see your private post.

***Who can comment on or like my private post?***  
Only logged-in Diaspora users you have placed in that aspect can comment on or like your private post.

***Who can reshare my private post?***  
Nobody. Private posts are not resharable. Logged-in Diaspora users in that aspect can always copy & paste it, though...

***When I comment on or like a private post, who can see it?***  
Only the people that the post was shared with can see its comments and likes (the people who are in the aspects that were selected by the original poster).  

###PUBLIC PROFILES  

***Who sees my public profile?***  
Any logged-in Diaspora user, as well as the wider internets, can see it. Each profile has a direct URL, so it may be linked to directly from outside sites. It may be indexed by search engines.

***What's in my public profile?***  
Your name, your 5 tags, and your photo. It's the stuff in the top section of the edit profile page. Your profile page also shows any public posts you have made.

***Who sees updates to my public profile?***  
Anyone can see changes if they visit your profile page on your pod. Public profile updates also propagate to the pods of people you are following, and the pods of people who are following you. 

***What do the tags on my public profile do?***  
They help people get to know you.  Your profile picture will also appear on the left hand side of those particular tag pages, along with anyone else who has them in their public profile.  

###PRIVATE PROFILES

***Who sees my private profile?***  
Any logged-in user that you are following (meaning, you have added them to one of your aspects). However, people following you, but whom you do **NOT** follow, will see only your public information.

***What's in my private profile?***  
Bio, location, gender, and birthday. It's the stuff in the bottom section of the edit profile page. Logged-in users who can see your private profile will also see the private posts that they are allowed to see, mixed in with your public posts, when they visit your profile page.

***Who sees updates to my private profile?***  
Any logged-in user that you are following sees changes to your private profile. Changes are propagated to the pods of everyone you follow.

###SHARING MODEL

***What happens when I add someone to one of my aspects?***  
You start sharing with them (asymmetrical sharing):

- They will receive a notification that you started sharing with them.

- They will see the *private* posts that you make to that aspect (in their stream).  

- You will see their *public* posts in your stream.  

- You *will not* see any of their *private* posts (unless they also add you to one of their aspects).

- They *will not* see your *public* posts in their stream (unless they also add you to one of their aspects).

- They will be able to see your private profile (bio, location, gender, birthday).

- You will appear under "*Only sharing with me*" on their contacts page (unless they add you to one of their aspects).  

If and when they add you to one of their aspects then all of this becomes reciprocal (symmetrical, bi-directional sharing).  

***Who are the people listed in "Only sharing with me" on my contacts page?***  
These are people that have added you to one of their aspects, but whom you have not (yet) added to one of your aspects.  In other words, they are sharing with you, but you are not sharing with them (asymmetrical sharing).  If you add them to an aspect, they will then appear under that aspect and not under "only sharing with you".  See above.

***Is there a list of people whom I have added to one of my aspects, but who have not added me to one of theirs?***  
No.  

###MORE ON POSTS AND POSTING 

***How do I hide a post?***  
***How do I stop getting notifications about a post that I commented on?***  
If you point your mouse at the top of a post, an X appears on the right.  Click it to hide the post and mute notifications about it.  There is a temporary "undo" option, and you can still see the post if you visit the profile page of the person who posted it.  

***How can I format the text in my posts (bold, italics, etc.)?***  
By using [Markdown](http://diasporial.com/tutorials/formatting-text).  [Give it a try](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus), or check out the full-blown [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  

***What is the character limit for posts?***  
10,000 characters.  That's 9,860 more characters than you get on Twitter! ;)  

***What is the character limit for posts shared through a connected service (Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr) with a smaller character count?***  
In that case your post is limited to the smaller character count, and the number of characters you have left to use is displayed.  

***Can I subscribe to someone's public posts with a feed reader?***  
Yes, but the formatting of the results is still not very good (you get raw markdown text).  To try it, go to someone's profile page and click the feed button in your browser, or you can copy the profile URL (i.e. https://joindiaspora.com/people/somenumber), and paste it into a feed reader. The resulting feed address looks like this: https://joindiaspora.com/public/username.atom  Diaspora uses Atom rather than RSS.  

###TAGS  

***What are tags for?***  
Tags are a way to categorize a post, usually by topic.  Searching for a tag will show all public posts that have that tag.  This lets people who are interested in a given topic find recent public posts about it.  

***Can I put tags in comments or just in posts?***  
A tag added to a comment will still appear as a link to that tag's page, but it will not make that post (or comment) appear on that tag page.  This only works for tags in posts.

***Who are the people on the left hand side of a tag page?***  
They are people who have listed that tag in their public profile.  

###MENTIONS  

***What is a "mention"?***  
A mention is a link to a person's profile page that appears in a post. When someone is mentioned they receive a notification that calls their attention to the post.  

***How do I mention someone when making a post?***  
Type the "@" sign and start typing their name.  A drop down menu should appear to let you select them more easily.  
However, adding mentions only works for people you have added to an aspect, and it does not work in comments.  
  
***Is there a way to see the posts in which I have been mentioned?***  
Yes, click "_Mentions_" in the left hand column on your home page.  

###RESHARING POSTS

***Can I reshare a public post with only certain aspects?***  
No, when you reshare a public post it automatically becomes one of your public posts.  To share it with certain aspects, copy and paste the contents of the post into a new post.  

***Can I reshare a private post with only certain aspects?***  
No, it is not possible to reshare a private post.  This is to respect the intentions of the original poster who only shared it with a particular group of people.  

###ACCOUNT AND DATA MANAGEMENT  

***How do I move my seed (account) from one pod to another?***  
In the future you will be able to export your seed from a pod and import it on another, but this is not currently possible. You could always open a new account and ask your contacts to search for it and add you again.  

***Can I download a copy of all of my data contained in my seed (account)?***  
Yes. At the bottom of your settings page there are two buttons for downloading your data.  

***How do I delete my seed (account)?***  
Go to the bottom of your settings page and click the close account button.  

###MISCELLANEOUS

***How do I delete an aspect?***  
In the list of aspects on the left of your home page, point your mouse at the aspect you want to delete.  Click the little 'edit' pencil that appears on the right.  Click the delete button in the window that appears.  

***Is there a quick way to go back to the top of a page after I scroll down?***  
Yes.  After scrolling down a page, click on the grey arrow that appears in the bottom right corner of your browser window.    

***Are there photo or video albums?***  
No, not currently (but see [cubbi.es](http://cubbi.es/)).
