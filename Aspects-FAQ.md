## All About Aspects

***What is an aspect?***

**Aspects** are the way you group your contacts on Diaspora. An aspect is one of the faces you 
show to the world.  It might be who you are at work, or who you are to your family, or who you 
are to your college friends.

***When I post to an aspect, who sees it?***

Only the people you have put in that aspect. Contacts you have that aren't in the aspect have
no way of seeing the post, unless you've made it public.

The flip side of this is that when you go to an aspect page, you only see posts from the people
you have put in that aspect.

***Do my contacts know what aspects I have put them in?***

No. They cannot see the name of the aspect under any circumstances. If you make an aspect "public",
then they can see other people who are in the aspect via "similar contacts."

***Can I rename an aspect?***

Yes. From the "All Aspects" page, look for a sidebar on the right hand side of the page that
lists your aspects. Click on the number of people in the aspect to bring up the aspect edit box.
Within that, there's a link near the top to rename.

***How do I move content between aspects?***

Once you've posted something, there's a "reshare" button on that post in your stream. From there
you can share it into other aspects.

***Can I post content to multiple aspects at once?***

Yes. The aspect names at the top of the page function like buttons. Click on one aspect to see a page
containing only that aspect's posts. Click a second aspect to get a page with both. Now you have
two selected aspects at the top of the page, and when you post something, it will go to both aspects.

Click an aspect again to deselect it.

***Can I add a person to multiple aspects?***

Yes. Click on All Aspects and look for the sidebar on the right hand side that lists your aspects. 
Click on the number of people in the aspect to bring up the aspect edit box. From there you can add
and remove people from the aspect, even if they are in another aspect as well.
