Frequently Asked Questions about aspects and privacy settings in Diaspora.

*** What is an *aspect*? ***

An aspect is one of the faces you show to the world.  It might be who you are at work, or who you are to your family, or who you are to your college friends.  Posts to an aspect are sent only to those people, and posts from those people appear in that aspect.

*** How to rename an aspect? ***

To rename an aspect go to manage page and click on aspect's title. You should be able to type there.

*** How to move content between aspects/post content to multiple aspects? ***

Moving content between aspects isn't supported yet. But you can post content to all aspects (using all aspects tab).
