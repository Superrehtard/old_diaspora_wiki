Here's a list of pods (seed hosters) run by the Diaspora community members. Remember, when you join one, you always log in there, but can follow friends on *all* of them. Now *that's* freedom!

###There are still security vulnerabilities in the current release of Diaspora, so please consider ALL information (including username and email) you post to the seeds on these pods as completely public.

Please do not try to crack these machines; they have been freely offered by people so that the project can move forward. Abusing their trust will make them go away.

If you wish to add your pod to the list, please edit this page adding details along the same pattern. Pods are listed in alphabetical order by pod name.

If an image is shown, the pod is *probably* online at the moment.

[notice by SargoDarya] If you're hosting a pod please consider adding yourself to the podup list at [[http://podup.sargodarya.de]]. It automatically checks if pods are online and sorts them based on there uptimes. It's free, people will notice your pod and you can track how your pod performs in the management console.
