This is a list of pods (Diaspora servers) run by Diaspora community members. Remember, 
when you join one, you always log in to that site. But you can follow friends on *any* pod, including
the pod run by the project founders at joindiaspora.com.

**This list is rather static.** While it can be used as a reference, we recommend that when you
are choosing which pod to sign up for, you also consider:

* [PodUp](http://podup.sargodarya.de) - sorts pods by uptime and will give you an idea of how stable a given pod is.
* [Podupti.me](http://podupti.me/) - similar service to PodUp, run by the fine folks at diasp.org.

If there is an unbroken image next to the pod name in the list below, the pod is probably online at the moment.

Pod maintainers:

* To add your pod to the list, please edit this page, adding details along the same 
pattern as the existing data. Pods are listed in alphabetical order by pod name.
* Please consider adding yourself to [the PodUp list](http://podup.sargodarya.de) as well. 
It's free, people will notice your pod, and you can track how your pod performs in the 
management console. [10/08/2011: Adding new pods to the list does not seem to work.]
