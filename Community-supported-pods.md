This is a list of pods (Diaspora servers) run by Diaspora community members. Remember, 
when you join one, you always log in to that site. But you can follow friends on *any* pod, including
the pod run by the project founders at joindiaspora.com.

**This list is rather static.** While it can be used as a reference, we recommend that when you
are choosing which pod to sign up for, you also consider:

* [Podupti.me](http://podupti.me/) - similar service to PodUp, run by the fine folks at diasp.org.
* [Pod Ranking](http://diaspora.wk3.org/) - also incorporating encryption and legal details, run by Christophe of wk3.org
* [Active Pods](https://diapod.net/active/) - A listing based on analysis of server access logs rather than performance metrics. 

If there is an unbroken image next to the pod name in the list below, the pod is probably online at the moment.

Pod maintainers:

* To add your pod to the list, please edit this page, adding details along the same 
pattern as the existing data. Pods are listed in alphabetical order by pod name.
