# Become a part of the Diaspora community 

Diaspora\* is an eclectic community.  We have
artists, teachers, moms, children, designers, hackers, and activists
from all over the world.  This is important because if we are going to
build an innovative way to communitcate online, we need to think very
differently than our predicessors, both Open Source and propriety.


There is only three requirements to join the Diaspora community.

1. Be excellent to each other.  We all are here to make the internet a
   better place to share with people on the web.
2. Have fun. The core devs started this in their free time because it
   sounded entertaining (and hard).  If we can't have a good time
together, shouldn't you be doing something else?
3. Learn something.  Diaspora is not a simple endevor, and our mission
   is not something we can complete in a day, a year, or maybe even a
lifetime.  That also means it is a constantly evolving, dynamic project
with lots of hard problems, all of which require different types of
expertise. Every one of our contributors is an expert in something, even
you!

If these sound like you, venture forth fair reader!

We are an international movement. If you would like to participate or help organize one in your area join us at [Meetup](https://meetup.com/Diaspora)


* Reporting Bugs

Currently, there are two outlets for this: [GetSatisfaction](https://getsatisfaction.com/) and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues).

[GetSatisfaction](https://getsatisfaction.com/) should be used for user feedback, feature requests, ideas, and questions. 
On the other hand, [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues) works better for bugs/issues/features involving source code/logs/UI elements. 

With both of these tools, it's helpful to provide as much information as possible.
