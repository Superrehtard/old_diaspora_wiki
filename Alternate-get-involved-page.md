# Become a part of the Diaspora community 

Diaspora\* is an eclectic community.  We have
artists, teachers, moms, children, designers, hackers, and activists
from all over the world.  This is important because if we are going to
build an innovative way to communitcate online, we need to think very
differently than our predecessors, both Open Source and proprietary.


There are only three requirements to join the Diaspora community.

  1. ***Be excellent to each other.***  
     We all are here to make the internet a better place to share with people on the web.
  2. ***Have fun.***  
     The core devs started this in their free time because it sounded entertaining (and hard).
     If we can't have a good time together, shouldn't you be doing something else?
  3. ***Learn something.***  
     Diaspora is not a simple endeavor, and our mission is not something we can complete in a day, 
     a year, or maybe even a lifetime.  That also means it is a constantly evolving, dynamic project
     with lots of hard problems, all of which require different types of
     expertise. Every one of our contributors is an expert in something, even you!

If these sound like you, venture forth fair reader!
