We should layout some goals for the wiki. What scope should it have etc. 

**So far **

*  Home
* Diaspora Roadmap and Wishlist 

**To Do**

* Separate wiki content into two clearly distinct areas (two different themes?) i.e. end-user and engineering (we could split 'engineering' into development / service management)

* Installation instructions -- yes, I know they are elsewhere, too.
* Unit tests -- tests/ui is referenced but missing
* API -- documentation / wishlist for an API (see [this presentation](http://scr.bi/d4XGx5))
* Data migration  -- migrating data from other silos (such as Facebook) / ideas that will also relate to [DataPortability.org](http://blog.dataportability.org/)
* Backup & Disaster Recovery -- tips/tricks/how-tos
* Security optimisation (testing/fuzzing tools to audit Diaspora security such as [Ronin](http://bit.ly/96Bex1)
* Scalability - how-tos etc., getting ready for large scale solutions / systems i.e. 1000s of nodes (see [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/))
* Marketing / getting the word out - How we're going to clearly communicate the benefits of Diaspora to the people who would be interested but aren't using it... yet!

*Please add pages you would like added, including a brief outline of the scope of that page.*
