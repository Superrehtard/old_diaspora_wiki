This space exists as a discussion area for thoughts about improving how our wiki is structured, and improving the heap of information that goes with it. Check back on it frequently; as this exists mostly as a place for brainstorming. Feel free to contribute any suggestions!


### Some things worth thinking about:
* As a podmin, what information is not readily available that should be?
* Are install guides up-to-date? (libraries, distributions, versioning)
* How can we restructure the wiki to be more relevant, but less sprawling?
* What resources can one podmin with their own set of experiences give to other podmins?
* How can we better describe the different moving parts?

## Stage One: Layout

Hans Fase has [created a mindmap](https://github.com/hfase01/diaspwiki-mindmap) of a proposal to move the existing information into directories related to these four sections:

* Community
* Developers
* Guidelines and Policies
* Podmin Resources
