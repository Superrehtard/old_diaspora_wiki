###403 DO NOT MOVE###

We're currently **moving this wiki over to our new project site**. The contents of this page are not important enough to be ported over because they are either very old, very outdated or wrong and misleading.

###Different names = Different ID's
Have seperate ID's with their own aspects, tags and stream, pretty much like having seperate accounts, for each name (e.g. have an account for your real name and one for your nickname). This way when you post to all aspects, the post is published under the same name to everyone, meaning people will all refer to you with the same name, not giving away your real or nickname.

Compare it with switching to a different user on your computer. You store multiple seperate accounts in one account which you can switch between using a 'change ID' button. Each ID has it's own handle and it's own profile page you can share. For each ID you choose a standard profile picture. This will be the picture displayed to those visiting your profile. You are supposed to use a decent or private avatar here! **Theres a mistake in the mock-up; you only need to give a username for the handle and a name.**

You can edit the public and private profile of each ID through Settings -> Profile, just like you do now.

###Per-aspect profile pictures 
In the profile edit section you can upload multiple profile pictures. These pictures will be ordered by number, the highest number being the most personal, the lowest number being the least personal. You can assign these pictures to aspects. These profile pictures will override the standard picture you set for the ID. If someone is in multiple aspects, they will see the most personal profile picture available to them.

###Why it works 
This way you can add family, friends and co-workers under the same ID containing your real name. The standard picture will be decent or vague, your co-workers will see you in a suit, your friends will see you in your swimming shorts and the co-worker who's also a friend will see your shorts too. 

When you hit 'change ID' you get to choose for example your nickname. Other people won't be able to relate this ID to any of your other ID's. You can use it for more anonymous stuff, like adding people you don't know or for MMORPG's. Or what about making an ID just for playing FarmVille and using other Apps? It's pretty much like having two accounts without having to log in and out all the time. People are already used to having multiple accounts so that shouldn't be a problem. 

###Keep it simple 
Sign up will remain exactly the same. You fill in data for your first ID after which you are ready to start using Diaspora.

After sign-up you need to go to the ID management section to add an extra ID, which most people never will because they only need their real name. The way this is built, you don't have to use the complicated system. Managing one ID works for most people. Eventually they can delve deeper into the system and create an extra ID. 

We don't bother newbies with all the complexity while still giving them the ability to use it!
