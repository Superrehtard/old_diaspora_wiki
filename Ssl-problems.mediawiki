'''work in progress'''

SSL setup can be tricky

* verifiable crt
* application.yml contains most of the setup
** pod_url should contain https:// and proper addr
** set up proper proxying in webserver
** ca_file should be able to verify your cert
*** openssl verify -CApath /dev/null -CAfile ca-certificates.crt  yourpod.crt 
** if you use socket_secure then socket_cert_chain_location should verify your cert and contain the cert

== Webfinger ==
Your <code>public/webfinger</code> directory should be empty
check your webfinger by retrieving PODURL/.well-known/host-meta it should point to proper https://PODURL
check hcard in the response file, it should point to https://PODURL
