"Why should I contribute to Free Software?"

There is one obvious benefit if one believes in Free Software as an idea or they are Free Software users. We will discuss some other benefits which may not be obvious. Some of the points to highlight are,

1. Working with best programmers in the world is an experience you won't get in a classroom or college lab.
2. Working on code that is used by thousands of people every day is a unique opportunity to test the ideas we learn as part of our courses.
3. Anyone can look at your code and evaluate you better. Gives you a better chance than may be a certificate or a good mark list that every one of you already have.
4. Code accepted into these projects are a testimony about the quality of your code, because there are strict quality control and lot of peer reviews before any code is accepted into these projects.
5. Ability to learn and play with latest and evolving technologies.
6. There is no compulsion, you chose what you like and you do it at your pace and interest.
7. We can help you find mentors in areas you want to focus. Some of us would be happy to help you get going with diaspora. We will start with a Ruby on Rails workshop so that all you have to have is an interest to contribute.

What is in there for us who are out to help you? We believe in Free Software and we want to make it better. We are always looking to expand our community.

Comments and additions welcome, the aim is to give a brief idea of benefits to students contributing to Free Software, motivate them to attend [[Pune Diaspora Meetup 3 | Ruby on Rails workshop]] and get more contributors to diaspora (may be for other Free Software projects too if there is an interest).
