If you have questions about anything Diaspora-related, the best way to get an answer 
quickly is to visit us in IRC. An IRC "channel" is roughly equivalent to a chatroom, or a
text-based group chat in Skype, or a Campfire room. 

It's fairly low-tech as group communication goes, but since we have contributors all over
the world in different time zones and with different levels of internet access, it works well
for us.

## Channels

We have 3 official IRC channels. Click the link to the join the channel in a new browser 
window. You can also download and use an IRC client such as <a href="http://colloquy.info/" target="_blank">Colloquy</a> 
for OS X or <a href="http://www.mirc.com/" target="_blank">mIRC</a> for Windows.

## Non-IRC Help

We have two mailing lists, both Google groups. They tend to have a slightly different audience than
the IRC channels, so if you can't get your question answered in IRC, you can try here.

* [Discussion list](http://groups.google.com/group/diaspora-discuss) - Google group for discussion of non-technical topics
* [Development discussion list](http://groups.google.com/group/diaspora-dev) - Google group for discussion of installation, source code, and other technical topics
