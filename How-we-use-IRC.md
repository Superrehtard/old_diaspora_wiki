If you have questions about anything Diaspora-related, the best way to get an answer 
quickly is to visit us in IRC. 

You might think, "IRC? For real? Is this 1994 again?" 

Yes. I mean, **no**! Just think of IRC as the open-source equivalent of a Campfire room.

## Channels

We have 3 official IRC channels, each one roughly equivalent to a chatroom. Click the link 
to the join the channel in a new browser window. You can also download and use an IRC client 
such as <a href="http://colloquy.info/" target="_blank">Colloquy</a> for OS X or <a href="http://www.mirc.com/" target="_blank">mIRC</a> for Windows.

* <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=diaspora" target="_blank">#diaspora on irc.freenode.net</a> - general discussion and help for folks installing Diaspora
* <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=diaspora-dev" target="_blank">#diaspora-dev on irc.freenode.net</a> - discussion of the source code and help for new developer contributors
* <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=diaspora-de" target="_blank">#diaspora-de on irc.freenode.net</a> - discussion in German.

## Non-IRC Help

We have two mailing lists, both Google groups. They tend to have a slightly different audience than
the IRC channels, so if you can't get your question answered in IRC, you can try here.

* [Discussion list](http://groups.google.com/group/diaspora-discuss) - Google group for discussion of non-technical topics
* [Development discussion list](http://groups.google.com/group/diaspora-dev) - Google group for discussion of installation, source code, and other technical topics
