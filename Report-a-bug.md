# How To Report a Bug

If you have a **feature idea**, the best place to report that is <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/diaspora target="_blank">GetSatisfaction</a>. 

If you've found an issue with an **existing feature** in Diaspora, you can report it using our bug-tracking system. Thank you for helping us make Diaspora better. :)

1. Register for an account on our bug-tracking system at 
<a href="http://bugs.joindiaspora.com/account/register" target="_blank">http://bugs.joindiaspora.com</a>.

2. Search for similar bugs - perhaps someone has already reported your issue! If so, please add
clarification and/or more information to the **existing** bug.

3. If not, create a new bug via the "new issue" tab once you've logged in.
