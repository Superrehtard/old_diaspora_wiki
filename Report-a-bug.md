# How To Report a Bug

If you have a **feature idea**, the best place to report that is <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/diaspora" target="_blank">GetSatisfaction</a>. 

If you've found an issue with an **existing feature** in Diaspora, you can report it using Github issues at https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues. Thank you for helping us make Diaspora better. :)

1. Register for an account on 
<a href="https://github.com" target="_blank"> Github </a> if you don't have one.

2. Search for similar bugs - perhaps someone has already reported your issue! If so, please add
clarification and/or more information to the **existing** bug.

3. If not, create a new bug via the "new issue" tab once you've logged in.
