# How To Report a Bug

1. Register for an account on our bug-tracking system at [http://bugs.joindiaspora.com/account/register](http://bugs.joindiaspora.com).

2. Search for similar bugs - perhaps someone has already reported your issue! If so, please add
clarification and/or more information to the **existing** bug.

3. If not, create a new bug via the "new issue" tab once you've logged in.
