# How To Report a Bug

Register for an account on our bug-tracking system at [http://bugs.joindiaspora.com/account/register](http://bugs.joindiaspora.com).

Search for similar bugs - perhaps someone has already reported your issue! If so, please add
clarification and/or more information to the existing bug.

If not, create a new bug via the "new issue" tab once you've logged in.

Follow best practices for bug reporting: see [this](http://www.webmproject.org/code/bug-reporting/) and [this](http://geekswithblogs.net/srkprasad/archive/2004/10/06/12224.aspx)
