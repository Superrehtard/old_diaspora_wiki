- **Aspect**   
    An aspect would be best described as a list of people, based on their relationship with you. When you have just signed up you have four _example aspects_, namely **Family, Work, Friends** and **Acquaintances**. These can be found on your left hand. The idea is that you sort your family members and co-workers into their corresponding aspects. This will come in very handy when you start sharing, as you can share a message with a combination of aspects very easily.

    a software that can be installed on a server by someone that has the knowledge to do so.  They in turn can allow people to register for an account on what they call their **pod**.  There are many of these pods already established across the internet with many users.  You register for a free account on a pod and you can seamlessly connect with other users on other pods the same as if you were making someone a friend on other social networking sites.  No matter which pod you are on, you are all using **Diaspora**.  If you have the technical skills, you can even set up your own pod for your family and or friends.  They can in turn connect to family and friends on your pod or even other pods with ease.

- **Follow** & **Follower** & **Mutual Follower**

    A **follower** is a person who is following you. Followers are created automatically when a person adds you to one or more of their aspects. They will start following your public posts and you get to see their shared aspect.

&nbsp;    
    When you and another person are following each other, we talk about mutual followers. This can be compared to being Facebook **friends**. Just like on Twitter, you need to be **mutual followers** in order to use certain features.

- **History of Diaspora**  	
    Diaspora is a social network created by people like you.  In 2010, a few young programmers from NYUâ€™s Courant Institute announced to the world that they wanted to create a new, safer, more privacy-aware social network.  They said they would need $10,000 to accomplish the task and instead, 6,479 people like you pledged $200,641.  Since then, the young programmers along with many volunteers from around the world have been working to create the next generation of Social Networks to allow you to socialize on the internet more safely.
