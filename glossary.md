- **Aspect**   
    An aspect would be best described as a list of people, based on their relationship with you. When you have just signed up you have four _example aspects_, namely **Family, Work, Friends** and **Acquaintances**. These can be found on your left hand. The idea is that you sort your family members and co-workers into their corresponding aspects. This will come in very handy when you start sharing, as you can share a message with a combination of aspects very easily.

- **Follow** & **Follower** & **Mutual**    
    A **follow** is a person whom you are following. In order to follow a person you will have to add them to one or more of your aspects. The person will get access to your aspect(s) and you will automatically start following their public posts.

    A **follower** is a person who is following you. Followers are created automatically when a person adds you to one or more of their aspects. They will start following your public posts and you get to see their shared aspect.

&nbsp;    
    When you and another person are following each other, we talk about mutual followers. This can be compared to being Facebook **friends**. Just like on Twitter, you need to be **mutual followers** in order to use certain features.
