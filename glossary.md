- **Alpha**     
   
- **Aspect**   
    An aspect would be best described as a list of people, based on their relationship with you. When you have just signed up you have four _example aspects_, namely **Family, Work, Friends** and **Acquaintances**.&nbsp; These can be found on your left hand.&nbsp; The idea is that you sort your family members and co-workers into their corresponding aspects.&nbsp; This will come in very handy when you start sharing, as you can share a message with a combination of aspects very easily.

    Ever wanted to to share something with just a certain group of people?&nbsp; **Diaspora** pioneered **Aspects**, the original system for sharing things with just the people you want.&nbsp; Of course, you can still tell the whole world too, if you want to.

- **Protocol** (Network Communications)     
   a set of formal rules describing how to transmit data, especially across a network.&nbsp; Low level protocols define the electrical and physical standards to be observed, bit- and byte-ordering and the transmission and error detection and correction of the bit stream. &nbsp; High level protocols deal with the data formatting, including the syntax of messages, the terminal to computer dialogue, character sets, sequencing of messages, **hand-shaking**, etc.
