- **Aspect**    
    An aspect would be best described as a list of people, based on their relationship with you. When you have just signed up you have four _example aspects_, namely **Family, Work, Friends** and **Acquaintances**.&nbsp; These can be found on your left hand.&nbsp; The idea is that you sort your family members and co-workers into their corresponding aspects.&nbsp; This will come in very handy when you start sharing, as you can share a message with a combination of aspects very easily.

    Ever wanted to to share something with just a certain group of people?&nbsp; **Diaspora** pioneered **Aspects**, the original system for sharing things with just the people you want.&nbsp; Of course, you can still tell the whole world too, if you want to.
