# Become a Contributor

## Diaspora needs you!
Diaspora is an open source project, which means all our code and documentation is available 
for free to anyone online. It also means that the project only thrives because we have a wonderful set of volunteer collaborators who help out in their free time.

Some of these volunteers are developers and help with the code, which is the "traditional" way
to help out an open source project, and is of course critical to the project's success. But the project also needs people who are not developers but who can contribute in other ways. This means that even if you're not a technical wizard, you can help Diaspora in all sorts of ways.

## Ways to Get Involved
Diaspora needs all sorts of contributions, aside from code itself. If anyone wants to link to getting started on any of these things, that would be wonderful.

####Reporting Bugs  

Currently, there are two outlets for this: the best is [https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues GitHub Issues] but, if you don't have a Github account (and don't want to create one), you can make a public post on Diaspora with the #bug hashtag.

Please, always try to give as much specific information as possible when reporting a bug (e.g. pod URL, screenshot, public post URL, and so on). You can find more detailed instructions [[Report a bug|here]].

####Run a Community Pod

As a decentralized network, Diaspora needs as many pods as possible for people to join. If you have a bit of technical knowledge and would like to run a pod, we'd love to have you as one of our community 'podmins'. Have a look at the [[FAQ for Pod Maintainers]], which includes [[Notes On Installing and Running Diaspora|installation guides for various operating systems]] and contact us on [[How-we-use-IRC|IRC]] if you need help or guidance to get you started.

####Donate to your Podmin

At the moment there is no way to contribute financially to Diaspora's development, but you can help your podmin out with their running costs. There should be a link in the side-bar to donate or to contact the podmin. They'd love to hear from you.

####Starting Meetups  

We are an international movement. If you would like to participate or help organize a meetup in your area, join us at [http://meetup.com/Diaspora Meetup].

####Translating   

Diaspora has been translated into over 45 languages. [https://github.com/MrZYX Jonne Ha√ü] has been managing all of them. We want to Diaspora to be available in more languages, and of course there is always need for translations of additions to the interface. If you think you can help, we'd love to hear from you. For more info look at [[How to contribute translations]].

####Grassroots Community Projects

* [[How-we-use-IRC|Helping others installing and maintain pods]]
* [[Logos, Icons, and Visual Art|Making fan art]]

####Spread the Word

If you don't have the technical skills to contribute code to our project but know someone who you think does and might be interested in getting involved, tell them about Diaspora! Tell them what you love about Diaspora, why you think it's a worthwhile project to contribute to, and send them our way. We'd love to hear from any developers who would like to help us improve Diaspora's software.

These are just a few ideas, and we love people who want to donate their skills to make our community more amazing.
