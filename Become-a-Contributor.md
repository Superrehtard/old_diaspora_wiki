# Become a Contributor

## Diaspora needs you!
Diaspora is an open source project, which means all our code and documentation is available 
for free to anyone online. It also means that, while there is a core team working on the project
full time, it only thrives because we have a wonderful set of volunteer collaborators who help out
in their free time.

Some of these volunteers are developers and help with the code, which is the "traditional" way
to help out an open source project, and is awesome. But many are not developers, and their 
contributions are awesome too.

## Ways to get involved
Diaspora needs all sort of help, way more than just code!
(if anyone wants to link to getting started on any of these things, that would be awesome)

####Reporting Bugs  

Currently, there are two outlets for this: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues) and in case you don't have a Github account (and don't want to create one) you can make a public post on Diaspora with the #bug hashtag.

Please, always try to specify as much information as possible, when reporting a bug (e.g. pod URL, screenshot, public post URL,...)

####Starting Meetups  

We are an international movement. If you would like to participate or help organize one in your area join us at [Meetup](http://meetup.com/Diaspora).

####Translating   

Diaspora is translated into over 45 languages. [Jonne Ha√ü](https://github.com/MrZYX) has been championing managing all of them. For more info: [[How to contribute translations]].
