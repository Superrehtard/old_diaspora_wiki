# Become a Contributor

## Diaspora needs you!
Diaspora is an open source project, which means all our code and documentation is available 
for free to anyone online. It also means that, while there is a core team working on the project
full time, it only thrives because we have a wonderful set of volunteer collaborators who help out
in their free time.

Some of these volunteers are developers and help with the code, which is the "traditional" way
to help out an open source project, and is awesome. But many are not developers, and their 
contributions are awesome too.
## Ways to get involved
Diaspora needs all sort of help, way more than just code!
(if anyone wants to link to getting started on any of these things, that would be awesome)
* Reporting Bugs
* Starting Meetups
* Making Fan Art
* Doing UI mockups
* Spreading the Word
* Participating in Weekly community meetings
* Blogging about Diaspora
* Writing copy
* Doing translations
* Writing documentaion
* Writing How-to guides/videos
* Design/User Interface work
* Donating
* Running a pod
* Helping others installing pods
* Running Diaspora for your company or community

These are just a few ideas, and we love people who want to donate their skills to make our community more amazing.
