# Become a Contributor

## Diaspora needs you!
Diaspora is an open source project, which means all our code and documentation is available 
for free to anyone online. It also means that, while there is a core team working on the project
full time, it only thrives because we have a wonderful set of volunteer collaborators who help out
in their free time.

Some of these volunteers are developers and help with the code, which is the "traditional" way
to help out an open source project, and is awesome. But many are not developers, and their 
contributions are awesome too.

## How to get started
Come talk to us. The best ways to get in touch in realtime are <a href="https://convore.com/diaspora" target="_blank">our Convore group</a>, 
or [[IRC|How-we-use-IRC]]. Tell us what you're interested in working on - code, tutorials,
feature ideas, mockups, running a pod, helping with the wiki, other - and we can help you
figure out how to get going.
