I realized that it might be hard to manage different aspects when you have more than about 5 of them and you want to drag people from one aspect to another.

A smaller size of the thumbs would be a first step. But still if there are 100 people in one aspect it will be hard to manage.
Thats why i thought of one drag&drop field for each aspect and a scrollable row of thumbnails next to it.

Lets say the bar shows the most important people of one aspect (like the ones with most activity for example). That gives you an overview of the poeple who belong to this aspect. 
Doing a mouse-over on the arrows scrolls to left and right. Picking a thumb from the bar and dragging it to another aspects drag&drop field admits the person to that aspect. 
It has to be possible to drag a person to more than just one aspect.

What do you think?

**Nygu:** Seems like a good idea. However, I think the thumbs of other people should be randomly picked as the people who have most activity aren't neccesarily your best friends/collegues. I have also read another idea which involved hiding the thumbs in an aspect untill after you hovered over it for a while. Although that allows for more aspects, it doesnt seem easy to work with. But imho, the most important people aren't those with the biggest mouth and ego. How about alphabetical last names? And lets be honest, the name of the aspect is already above the screen anyway so it should be easy to work out for anyone. Totally agree with this concept though. :)

**Tobias28:** Good call! I totally agree with you. Picking the thumbs by activity is not the right criteria. Randomly (nice for coming across people who i haven't been in contact with for a while) or alphabetically (makes it searchable easier) seem to be better. Thanks for feedback!
