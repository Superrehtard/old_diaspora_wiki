#manage page
i realized that it might be hard to manage different aspects when you have more than about 5 of them and you want to drag people from one aspect to an other.

A smaller size of the thumbs would be a first step. But still if there are 100 people in one aspect it will be hard to manage.
Thats why i thought of one drag&drop field for each aspect and a scrollable row of thumbnails next to it.

Lets say the bar shows the most important people of one aspect (like the ones with most activity for example). That gives you an overview of the poeple who belong to this aspect. 
Doing a mouse-over on the arrows scrolls to left and right. Picking a thumb from the bar and dragging it to another aspects drag&drop field admits the person to that aspect. 
It has to be possible to drag a person to more than just one aspect.

What do you think?
