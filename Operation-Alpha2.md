##What is Alpha2?

Alpha2 is the codename of the project that focuses on *improving the things we already have*. Once this project is finished it should be easier for mainstream users to sign up and get started on Diaspora. Alpha2 is a major leap towards broader adoption.

Alpha2 includes:

* Improving the publicly available pages
* Improving the onboarding process
* Improving the general user experience
* Fixing small bugs
* Tweaking features to make them even more awesome
* Making Diaspora look awesome enough to be worth joining

It is **not** about adding cool new features. We'd much rather have a quality feature set than a big one. Features that are important for the user experience (recommended contacts/blocking users) *are* part of the project.

##How do we operate?
We will be labelling issues on GitHub, which are in line with the points above, with 'Alpha2'. These issues can be picked up by developers and contributors after which they can send pull requests. The pull requests will then be merged into the code of Diaspora by the core developers.

##When is Alpha2 done?
Alpha2 is supposed to be a short term project and one we would like to actually 'finish'. The project is finished when all labelled issues are solved. Rest assured we will only label issues that truely matter!

To give an idea of the time frame, we would like to be completely done with Alpha2 **before the end of september**.

##Show your support!
Even if you can't code you can still help by showing the contributors and developers your support. You can also suggest issues to be included in Alpha2. On Diaspora we use the tag "#Alpha2".
