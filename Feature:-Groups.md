Gathering requirements to determine desired behavior of a new feature which allows users to group users for various purposes. This is different than Aspects, but probably related.

Still in the data gathering stage.

There are a few requisite properties of a (discussion) group, then lots of other, optional bells & whistles. To start, something like this ...

* Name for the object type: GROUP, or forum, synapse, rhizome or cell-cluster? Call ours the Friends_of_the_Moth group (lepidopterists).

* Probably 'owned' by one or more members. Ownership should be transferable so that the group doesn't become orphaned.

* Internal dialogs are hidden from outsiders. I know this is going to offend some staunch open-source/open-content purists, but it is crucial to getting real work done. Some groups are by their nature sensitive: medical or recovery groups, young kids, families, some minorities, political parties, small businesses, software developers, artists & other intellectual property holders. Of course, open-access groups would also be a good thing.

* Need a path for finding & joining a group that you like.

* The owner(s) should be able to remove trouble makers. 

* Likewise, the owner(s) should be able to retire the group.

That looks like about it. Other concerns would be how long group posts exist & are searchable? During development of a group mechanism there might be 'beta' constraints, something like 20/20: 20 members max. Posts die after 20 weeks.

As others have mentioned, a group would be a distinct entity or data type, from a pod or seed or user/member.
