Gathering requirements to determine desired behavior of a new feature which allows users to group users for various purposes. This is different than Aspects, but probably related.

Still in the data gathering stage.

There are a few requisite properties of a Diaspora (discussion) group, then there are lots of other, optional bells & whistles. To start, something like this ...

* Name for the aggregate entity/object type: GROUP, or (in keeping with the botanical metaphor) forum, synapse, rhizome, cell-cluster, garden?  Welcome to the Friends_of_the_Moth (lepidopterists' group).
 
* Probably 'owned' by one or more members. Ownership should be transferable so that the group doesn't become orphaned.  Mechanism for anyone to create a new group.
 
* Internal dialogs are hidden from outsiders.  This may offend some staunch open-source/open-content purists, but it is crucial to getting serious work done. Some groups are by their nature sensitive: medical or recovery groups, families & kids, some minorities, political parties, software developers, artists & other intellectual property holders â€” in short, much of what should be happening on Diaspora.  Of course, open-access groups would also be a good thing.
 
* Need a path for finding & joining a group that one would like to join.

* Owner(s) should be able to remove trouble makers. 
 
* Likewise, owner(s) should have a mechanism to retire the group.
 
Lesser concerns would be how long group posts exist & are searchable? During development of a group mechanism there might be 'beta' constraints, on maximum group size, eg.  Export conversations.  Group image gallery, events calendar, etc. 
  
As others have mentioned, a group would be a distinct entity or data type, from a pod or seed/user/member.
