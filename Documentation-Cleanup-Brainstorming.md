## What's going on?

Currently, the documentation for the Diaspora project is kind of messy. Granted, there's enough information here to get a basic pod going, but it's somewhat cluttered, some information is missing, and other information is outdated.

## What can be done about it?

A restructuring and cleanup of documentation is necessary. Furthermore, we have a few questions that we'd like to ask enthusiasts, community contributors, and podmins. We want our documentation to be comprehensive, current, and cohesive.

1. What do you feel that the documentation is missing?
2. Have you noticed any documentation that isn't up to date, and is no longer correct?
3. What snags have you run into in trying to run your own pod, and what would you like documented about those problems?
4. Is there anything in the documentation that just plain doesn't make sense to you?
5. Do you feel that the GitHub wiki serves its purpose well, or do you think a different solution would be necessary in the future? (MediaWiki, MoinMoin, Tiddlywiki, etc.)
