The (Diaspora-)mailing list is basically a forum where you can use your email address to create and reply on topics. *Actually you just can use the Google Groups web-interface to use the mailing list, but this instructions are for those who don't have a Google account.*

## Subscribe (join) the mailing list
You need to "subscribe" to a mailing list in order to be able to reply on topics. ***If you subscribe on a mailing list, you always get a mail when a new topic or reply on a topic was created***, so it'd be a good idea to set some filters or use a separate email address.

To subscribe to the "diaspora-discuss" mailing list, send a mail with whatever content to `diaspora-discuss+subscribe@googlegroups.com`. You'll get a mail from Google Groups on which you have to reply in order to verify your subscription.

## Create new topics/reply to topics
  - To create a new topic in "diaspora-discuss", send a mail to `diaspora-discuss@googlegroups.com`, subject as topic title, content as topic's first post's content.
  - To reply to a topic, reply to one of those mail-notifications you get when you are subscribed to the mailing list.
