Here's a list of what I believe is important to look into at least before the beta. It involves improvements to the UX, tweaks and features. You should try to work through these points or come up with a better answer. Almost everything on this list is from the point of view of a mainstream user so use it to your advantage.

##Aspects
We should get rid of ‘all aspects’ in the left menu and replace it with having litterly all aspects selected. Having no aspects selected should say: select one or more aspects from the left menu. Have a way to set default aspects. This stimulates sharing with a selection of common aspects instead of posting everything to ‘all aspects’. You could exclude your ‘work’ or ‘teachers’ aspect for example.

##Public / private
Make all comments on a public post public, both to people logged in as well as people not logged in to Diaspora. Add a small note near the share button to let people know their comments will be publicly viewable and also add ‘and comments’ in the hover message on ‘Public’. Get rid of the /p/ page and display the /status_message/ page to people not logged in. This should solve a lot of uncertainty about visibility and improves the general experience.

Add a hover over message for a ‘Limited’ post by a contact for more consistency. For example: “This post is shared with a limited audience.” 

##Publisher
Don’t send public posts, shared with only a selection of aspects, to all aspects! Make the post publicly available on the profile without sending it to the streams of people not in the aspects. The other solution is to only allow public posting when all aspects are selected. Right now ‘public’ overrides the aspect selection, which is unexpected behavior.

Make mentions stand out in the publisher, like the tags on the profile edit page. This should also solve adding punctuation right after a mention.

Have an aspect dropdown next to the share button. This will be a major UX improvement to new and existing users. This can also replace the labels in the bookmarklet, solving the problem of too many aspects / translations there too. *This is backed by a real UX expert whom Dennis Schubert talked too!*

##Messages
Have a dropdown menu. People have come to expect this after the notification dropdown. Also allow middle mouse-button clicking on the icon to go directly to the full notifications/conversations page.

##Stream
Don’t hide videos in the stream anymore. It may have seemed to be a very good idea to keep Diaspora clean and minimalistic but people barely watch videos posted by their contacts. The video experience on Diaspora is pretty bad as is. Showing them right away will not hurt the experience more than photos do.

*Note by untitaker: Might be a privacy (on non-windows also a performance) issue, as well as the cubbi.es images.*

Get the ‘x <3’ on one line with the comment and like links and give the posts and comments a bit of extra love in general. Something like this: (exclude the likes on comments for now).

The names of those who liked the content should go in a hover instead (as they aren’t important enough to justify taking a lot of space).

The time ago really should go back under the post like it used to be. Not only does it look better; right now it also switches the name and time ago on RTL languages. It also goes very well with the apps (Public 1 minute ago via Cubbi.es). 

Get rid of the aweful  and  smilies. Either replace them with real smilies or delete them altogether.

The new AJAX’y likes aren’t really that great. People don’t really care about the names as much as being able to quickly see the amount of them. It’s also looks like it’s a bug, which is just bad. Should revert that one.

##Tags
Clean up their appearance a bit as they are kinda overkill right now:

![The current way a tag is displayed.](http://i.imgur.com/72Xtk.png)

Add the followed tags to the right menu and let the left menu float again.

##Menus
Make all sections in the right menu collapse/expandable for now; turn it into a customizable widget bar in the future. Also add suggested contacts there.

##Photos
Have a huge photo viewer pop up when you click on a photo in the stream, with previous/next buttons, a comment section and likes. Also needs a link to the full size image. Diaspora should have a much better photo experience. It’s one of those things we can easily do better than Facebook. The viewer should solve it for now; before the end of the year we will need to have full-fletched photo albums.

##Suggested contacts
-	Suggest people with the same tags added to their profile
-	Mutual contacts
-	Facebook friends
-	Get names from Twitter and look for them in Diaspora, output the matches
-	Have people suggest contacts

Suggested contacts should be both a widget in the right menu as well as a section on the contact page.

##Birthdays
Add birthday notifications and mail about them to make people return to Diaspora.

##Profile
Title and item fields which can be assigned to aspects and ‘public’. This will allow for the much craved ‘per aspect profiles’ and offers a lot of possibilities. Solves a big problem for now (e.g. we can finally privately put up our telephonenumber and emailadres for our true friends). Probably needs some refining in the future but we need to take a step.

##Import RSS
The ability to import RSS into your stream in order to follow blogs and site updates. This will add feedreader functionality to Diaspora. Can very well be tied in with the ‘Collections’ concept I read in the tracker.

##Hovercards
We could use these for a visit profile, message, mention and chat button, as well as for adding the contact to aspects. We can do this all over the place, making the interface a lot more consistent. Also possibly removes the need for ‘add to aspect’ buttons in places where the buttons don’t fit, like the tag page and possibly the 'suggested contacts' page.

Have hovercards on mentions too. Add a micro-bio to the card to make things more personal and stimulate contacting people found on other peoples posts.

##Contact management
The contacts page doesn’t provide any functionality that can’t be done in an easier way elsewhere, except for doing a lot of changes on a lot of contacts. We do need the page because people will expect it to exist but it’s really got to be better. One way of massively improving the usability of the page is by adding real-time contact browsing

“All contacts” is the only real feature though. Adding to aspects is already as easy as can be. Especially if it’s going to be in the hover/clickcards.

##Notifications
Show the amount of unread notifications in the title of the page.

##Homepage
A lot of people wonder whether Diaspora still exists and whether it’s actually being used. It would be nice if we could have a stream of public posts on the homepage of the pod, to show that Diaspora is alive and kicking. Also helps with finding contacts. Improves the first impression of potential users and gives a clear signal to the existing users that public really means public.

There should also be some general information about Diaspora, shipped with the pod. It should list some of the features we already have, some that will come soon. Tell people it's decentralised like e-mail and that they can talk to eachother whichever server they use.

##Reshare
This feature would be the bomb! Only for public posts. Reshare the post with the avatar and name of the owner, let the owner be able to withdraw the post and all of its reshares. It’s already on a branche so I hope it could be finished.

##Change emailadress
This is a very basic and much needed feat.

##More networks!
We need to be able to post to more networks. Show people that we connect to everything and that they can use Diaspora for posting to all sorts of accounts.

##Importing tweets/Facebook stream
Imagine all your friends are on Facebook/Twitter and you are locked in. You get a Diaspora invite and you can follow your fb stream/tweets through Diaspora. You start using Diaspora and invite a few close friends. They join and can still see fb and twitter. You start communicating on Diaspora as well and activity on other networks goes down. Eventually you will switch altogether. Evolution WIN.

##Likes in comments
Title says it all. New users are going to love seeing that.

##Find people in your area
Can we do this? Would be interesting to see if anyone in your area is on Diaspora.

##[Add checkboxes on aspects list](http://imgur.com/a/jf6Pu)
**untitaker:** Most users associate checkboxes with the ability to select multiple items, so:

![State 1](http://i.imgur.com/u6noR.jpg) ![State 2](http://i.imgur.com/TZRY4.jpg) ![State 3](http://i.imgur.com/hYSPa.jpg)

##Minor things
  - **untitaker:** links to posts in the notifications dropdown should make the page scroll to the post (if possible), instead of opening it.
  - **untitaker:** There are too much icons beside the searchbar; At least the home-icon is not needed.
  - **untitaker:** Right sidebar is way too bloated, there's also unneccessary stuff in it.
  - **untitaker:** User menu (#user_menu) is a bit empty, some stuff (eg. from the right sidebar) could be moved in there.
