###301 MOVED PERMANENTLY###

We're currently **moving this wiki over to our new project site**. The contents of this page have  already been carried over, so _any new changes here will not be reflected in the new wiki_.  
New link: http://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/How_We_Communicate#Mailing_Lists

----

A [mailing list][mailing-list] is basically a forum where you can use your email address to create and reply on topics. 

You can find our list's web interfaces on Google Groups. If you have a Google Account, you can just go there and subscribe and post from your browser, or simply browse the archives.

  * **[Diaspora-dev][d-dev]**  
    This is where all the development-related topics are discussed. 
    Bigger code-changes affecting all Pod-Administrators (and where some action is required) will also be announced here.
  * **[Diaspora-discuss][d-discuss]**  
    Here you can talk about and ask for pretty much anything involving Diaspora*, including conceptual discussions about 
    [[feature requests|Feature Request Guidelines]]

**Many people might not want to register with Google just to use a mailing list, so here is how to do it like it's 1999.**

### Subscribe (join) a mailing list
You need to "subscribe" to a mailing list in order to be able to reply on topics. ***If you subscribe on a mailing list, you always get a mail when a new topic or reply on a topic was created***, so it'd be a good idea to set some filters or use a separate email address.

To subscribe to the "diaspora-discuss" mailing list, send a mail with whatever content to `diaspora-discuss+subscribe@googlegroups.com`. You'll get a mail from Google Groups on which you have to reply in order to verify your subscription.

### Create new topics/reply to topics
  - To create a new topic in "diaspora-discuss", send a mail to `diaspora-discuss@googlegroups.com`, 
    subject as topic title, content as topic's first post's content.
  - To reply to a topic, reply to one of those mail-notifications you get when you are subscribed to the mailing list. 
    Be sure to "reply to list" and not to the sender.
