here are thing that would be so cool if people did for D*

1. collapse all of our emails, and better organize and refactor them so we dont have to deal with crap everytime we touch them

2. add a copy-to clipboard thing on the invite link(https://github.com/mojombo/clippy)

3. make a branding bundle - put all of the D* assets in a public/branding folder, and update all the references, which will make it easy for people to swap them out if they want

4.Make an admin panel that was really useful for podmins

5. Add a "who runs this" page which would be easy to configure from the interface or settings.

6.
