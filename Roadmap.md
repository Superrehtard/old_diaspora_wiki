# Diaspora Roadmap

## The Next Few Weeks

You can see what the core team is currently working on in <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/61641" target="_blank">Diasporaâ€™s Pivotal Tracker project</a>. 
Tracker is where we keep our most immediate priorities, and it's a good indication of what we 
are going to be working on in the next 2 or 3 weeks.

You can also look at the [branches](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/branches) we have in our git-repo, to see how actively a feature is being developed.

## The Road to Beta
These features are currently being actively worked on in. After these features are tackled, we feel that Diaspora as a platform will be Beta.

### Publisher
The Publisher is Diaspora's current way of creating posts and sharing thoughts, pictures, and other content. We're looking at ways to make this a much more personalized experience. Being able to pick out templates for different posts can give the user a much more immersive, personal experience, and it empowers them to make posts look the way that they want them to look.

### Reshares
Currently, reshares function in a less-than-optimal way for sharing content and ideas, so we want to look into ways to make this more effective than before. The current model creates a copy linked to the original post, and we want to explore ways that this can be done more effectively.   

### Stream Previews
Being able to preview content before it's put into the stream and shared with everyone is immensely important. This would give users the opportunity to put any finishing touches on their posts before they send them on their way to the social platforms and users that they connect to.

### Profiles
Profiles should be an expression of the user's own social identity, rather than just a placeholder with a name and a bio. 

### Federation
It's important that we improve how pods talk to one another. We feel that improving on the existing model can allow for greater flexibility, and can be done in a way that upholds the importance of user data and privacy. Improving the way pods communicate can also improve the response time between users on different pods, which is essential in upholding the principles of the decentralized social web.

### Dashboard
Needs discussion.
