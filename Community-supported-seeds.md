Here's a list of seeds run by the Diaspora community members. 

###There are many security vulnerabilities in the current release of Diaspora, so simply visiting these seeds may harm your computer. Consider ANY information you post to these seeds as completely public, including your email address and password.

Please do not try to hack these machines; they have been freely offered by people so that the project can move forward. Abusing their trust will make them go away.

If you wish to add your seed to the list, please edit this page adding details along the same pattern. Seeds are listed in alphabetical order by seed name.

If an image is shown, the seed is *probably* online at the moment.
