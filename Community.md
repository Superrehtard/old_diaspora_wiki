One of Diaspora's greatest assets is its community. We have a broad network of people that are dedicated to our cause and use Diaspora everyday to express themselves. Many of our users love helping out with the project. If you want to pitch in, feel free to take a look at the categories below!

## [Welcoming Committee](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Welcoming-Committee)

## [Community Code Chat](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Code-Chat)
The Diaspora core team holds a community chat every other week to tell the community at large about what's going on with the project, future goals, and where they're at. This link also keeps copies of logs from previous chat sessions.
