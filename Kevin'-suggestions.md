##Homepage
A lot of people wonder whether Diaspora still exists and whether it’s actually being used. It would be nice if we could have a stream of public posts on the homepage of the pod, to show that Diaspora is alive and kicking. Also helps with finding contacts. Improves the first impression of potential users and gives a clear signal to the existing users that public really means public.

There should also be some general information about Diaspora, shipped with the pod. It should list some of the features we already have, some that will come soon. Tell people it's decentralised like e-mail and that they can talk to eachother whichever server they use.

##Importing tweets/Facebook stream
Imagine all your friends are on Facebook/Twitter and you are locked in. You get a Diaspora invite and you can follow your fb stream/tweets through Diaspora. You start using Diaspora and invite a few close friends. They join and can still see fb and twitter. You start communicating on Diaspora as well and activity on other networks goes down. Eventually you will switch altogether. Evolution WIN.

##Likes in comments [In progress]
Title says it all. New users are going to love seeing that.

##Contacts search
Share the user index of a pod with all other pods in the network to improve the people search functionality.

  - **untitaker:** I think they are already doing that.

##Find people in your area
Can we do this? Would be interesting to see if anyone in your area is on Diaspora.

##Reshare
This feature would be the bomb! Only for public posts. Reshare the post with the avatar and name of the owner, let the owner be able to withdraw the post and all of its reshares. It’s already on a branche so I hope it could be finished.

##Change emailadress
This is a very basic and much needed feat.

##More networks!
We need to be able to post to more networks. Show people that we connect to everything and that they can use Diaspora for posting to all sorts of accounts.
