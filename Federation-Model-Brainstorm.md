Here's my brainstorm for a more focused federation model.

**There's two flavours of networks:**
1. Meeting new people -> "Gather interesting people from _the pool_" -> Through hashtags -> Small pods fail to deliver because of small pool -> Leads to centralisation
2. Stay in contact with friends -> "Direct connecting" -> Pods for individuals work perfectly ->  Decentralisation

Diaspora tries to do both "meeting people" as well as "decentralisation". Combination leads to architectural/traffic problems. Current model automatically leads to centralisation as small pods fail to deliver.

Separate the processes!

1. Go by model 2 for your decentralisation fix. Protect privacy and ownership for all _private_ content. This is a self-sustainable model for connecting to people you know. Does exactly what Kickstarters donated their money for. Saves the planet. No evil at all. Low traffic, simple system!

2. Build a central index that provides model 1 as an add-on for Diaspora. This will contain Diaspora's "evil" part. Lets call it "The Monster".

Within model 1, allow users to authorize The Monster. When authorised, The Monster will pull all records of your public posts with hashtags into a centralised monolithic database to provide a perfect hashtag search system by delivering results back to model 1 servers. You can search these posts even when you do not allow The Monster to pull your posts (to avoid dilemma's).

The Monster only pulls and provides tagged public posts. He does nothing else. He does not host them, just indexes them for reference. From within model 1, we could tell the monster to "forget our posts", clearing the index, or "forget after x days". We control The Monster ourselves.

The Monster does not see any private messages or friend relations (as opposed to Facebook). Because The Monster is completely separated from model 1, it is possible to completely block The Monster. Therefore people can choose between a fully decentralised network and a semi-decentralised network. The Monster may be evil; he's still a lot less evil than Facebook because he's missing lots of context.

TL;DR: decentralise all that can be decentralised and that needs protection, provide all other services through a centralised, user-controlled system.
