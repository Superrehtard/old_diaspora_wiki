# Invitations

## Getting an invite

The Diaspora installation run by the project's founders is located at 
<a href="http://joindiaspora.com" target="_blank">joindiaspora.com</a>.
We are currently in private alpha, meaning that you must be invited by someone in order to 
register and start using the site. We have a <a href="http://joindiaspora.com" target="_blank">mailing list</a> you can 
join if you'd like to be invited. 

However, because Diaspora is a distributed system, you can participate even if you haven't
been invited yet! There are two ways to do it.

1. You can make an account on an unofficial server that has open signups. You will still be able to 
have friends on joindiaspora.com, as well as all the unofficial Diaspora servers. **Please understand
that these servers are not run by the project's founders, and the user experience may be quite
different.** We have a list of [[community-run servers|Community-supported pods]].

2. You can run your own server. You will be able to connect with people on joindiaspora.com and
all the other servers. At this point, since we're in alpha, we haven't put much work into making
the installation completely smooth. As a result you need to be comfortable with *nix system 
administration to take this route. See our [[installation instructions|Installing and Running Diaspora]] 
for details.

## Backchannels

Some folks have had success posting an invitation request to Twitter with 
<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23diaspora" target="_blank">hashtag #diaspora</a>.

There is also an Identi.ca group called <a href="http://identi.ca/group/diasporainvites">!diasporainvites</a> to which you can post to request an invitation.

There is also a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/g9pw5/the_diaspora_invite_diaspora/?sort=new">diaspora invite party on reddit.com</a>. You can post a comment with your email or pm someone who has invites.
