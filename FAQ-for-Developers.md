We've started adding questions that we see a lot to this page, but it doesn't cover everything.
If you have other questions, the best way to get an answer quickly is to visit us in IRC. 
You might think, "IRC? For real? Is this 1994 again?" 

Yes. I mean, **no**! Just think of IRC as the open-source equivalent of a Campfire room. **Links
to IRC channels and mailing lists are at the bottom of this page.**

### Mailing lists

We have two mailing lists, both Google groups. They tend to have a slightly different audience than
the IRC channels, so if you can't get your question answered in IRC, you can try here.

* [Development discussion list](http://groups.google.com/group/diaspora-dev) - Google group for discussion of installation, source code, and other technical topics
