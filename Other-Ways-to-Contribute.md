###301 MOVED PERMANENTLY###

We're currently **moving this wiki over to our new project site**. The contents of this page have  already been carried over, so _any new changes here will not be reflected in the new wiki_.  
New link: http://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/index.php?title=Other_Ways_to_Contribute

----

If you don't have coding experience, or just don't know Ruby on Rails, there are other, important ways to contribute to the project.

**Start by signing up -** Check [joindiaspora.com](http://www.joindiaspora.com) for an invite, or join a [[community supported pod|Community supported pods]] and connect with people. Start using the software and get a feel for it.

**File Bugs and Request Features -** Let the coders know what's missing, what you need, and what doesn't work. Feedback from users drives the direction of the project. Learn more [[here|Report a Bug]].

**Write About It -** If you blog, or tweet, or have some vocal platform, talk about Diaspora. Let people know you're there, and how you like it.

**Add to this Wiki -** If you've got any helpful tips to add, or if something here isn't very clear, edit this wiki. It's a great place to pool user information, so new people can find help and learn about the project.

**Make a Video -** Make screencasts, make animations, make slideshows. Show people what it is, how it works, and why it's good for you.
